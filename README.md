ZendCon App Contest 2013
=======================

This is my contribution to the ZendCon APP Contest 2013.

I have used ZF2 for the app backend and Sencha Touch 2 for the front end.

You can see the application running on http://zendconapp.dossantos.com.au

So far the results haven't been announced yet. I'm still waiting.
