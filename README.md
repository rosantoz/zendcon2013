ZendCon App Contest 2013
=======================

This is my contribution to the ZendCon APP Contest 2013.

I have used ZF2 for the app backend and Sencha Touch 2 for the front end.

You can see the application running on http://zendconapp.dossantos.com.au (please use a webkit browser such as chrome or safari, a mobile phone or a tablet)

This app wasn't the winner, but the project might be useful to someone.

I hope you enjoy.
